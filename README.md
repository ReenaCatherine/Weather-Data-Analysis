# Weather-Data-Analysis

This repository is a hub for exploring and understanding historical weather patterns through data analysis. Whether you're a Weather Enthusiast, Data Analyst, or just curious about climatic trends, this project provides valuable insights derived from diverse datasets.

## Features
* **Data Collection**: Access a curated collection of historical weather datasets from reliable sources.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Dive into the data through detailed exploratory analyses to uncover interesting patterns and correlations.
* **Data Insights**: Gain a deeper understanding of historical weather patterns through insightful analyses and visualizations.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Experience dynamic visualizations through interactive dashboards, making it easy to customize your exploration.

## Steps to Execute the project
 1. **Webscraped Dataset:**
   The dataset was obtained by webscraping from the Estes Park Weather website. To replicate the process:
      * Visit the website: Estes Park Weather Archive Reports.
      * Choose a specific date for which you want historical weather data.
      * Use a web scraping tool or a Python library like BeautifulSoup to extract the data from the HTML tables. (This part is added in the ipynb file)
      * Save the extracted data as csv file in a directory accessible to your analysis tools.
     
 2. **Analysis Notebook:**
   Open the ipynb file (Jupyter notebook) using your preferred environment. The notebook contains code for analyzing the webscraped weather dataset. Execute the cells to run the analysis and generate insights.

 3. **Tableau Visualization:**
   Load the Weather_Data_Visualization.twb file into Tableau Desktop. Explore the provided visualizations and customize the dashboards to extract insights from the webscraped weather data.
